I entered the following text in chat GPT

Content Requirements:
At least one header section.
A navigation bar with at least three links.
At least one image.
Main content area with at least three sections/articles.
A footer with copyright and contact information.
Design Requirements:
Use of external CSS for styling.
The design should be responsive and visually appealing.

this site should be about roses

AI then general the html and css codes with a brief description about what the codes would create.

I then replaced the blank jpg image code with a pic of roses from google.
